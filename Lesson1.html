                    <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">During the 10th and 11th centuries, in order to protect local regions, local <a href="Home.html#lor" class="kword">lords</a> were beginning to build wooden castles with a <a href="Home.html#mot" class="kword">motte-and-bailey</a> design from which to administer their rule. From these castles, they assumed power over populations in the surrounding countryside and began to not listen to their <a href="Home.html#ove" class="kword">overlords</a>. The higher class was forced to accommodate for the local lords. There was also a shift from power and wealth being divided equally amongst family members to a <a href="Home.html#pri" class="kword">primogeniture</a> system where the eldest child became the focus for <a href="Home.html#inh" class="kword">inheritance</a>. For commoners, this meant they went from being free <a href="Home.html#peas" class="kword">peasants</a> to being forced into a lower class to serve the demands of the local lord.</p2>

                    <!-- Seocond paragraph -->
                    <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">The word and concept of <a href="Home.html#feu" class="kword">feudalism</a> was borrowed from a French system called Libri Feudorum. This system set out rules governing ownership of land called a feudum or <a href="Home.html#fie" class="kword">fief</a>. Property holders were called vassi or <a href="Home.html#vas" class="kword">vassals</a> who had to serve a lord. They often expected vassals to pay them dues in exchange for something else such as providing military services or granting land. Vassals and lords would chain all the way to the top of the monarchy reaching the king, forming a pyramid shaped economy. Luckily feudalism began to rapidly decline due to reasons such as the development of towns into cities, providing alternative styles of living and opportunity, and the decline in population from an ongoing plague.</p2>

                    <!-- Paragraph:topic 2 -->
                    <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">Around the 10th century, a distinct class of people known as knights began. At first, they were <a href="Home.html#mer" class="kword">mercenary</a> thugs and would take advantage of the chaos happening in Europe at the time. To control this, society created a code of conduct that demonstrates a standard of knightly behaviour, or chivalry. Churches also controlled the situation by creating the <a href="Home.html#pea" class="kword">Peace of God</a> or the Truce of God, stating that the knights were their protectors and the protectors of the people. However, these strategies did not prove to be the most effective, as some knights continued to demonstrate very inappropriate behaviour such as <a href="Home.html#pil" class="kword">pillaging</a> small villages or participating in brutal killings. To become a knight, a person needed to be of <a href="Home.html#nob" class="kword">noble</a> birth. Training would start at a very young age and be instructed by an older knight. During these years, they learned how to handle horses, hunt, and fight using mock weapons. Once the trainee reached the age of 14, they then became a <a href="Home.html#squ" class="kword">squire</a> who held more responsibilities such as fighting with real weapons, learning chivalry, and starting an education. Once the squire becomes an adult and completes his training, he is then dubbed a knight by having a sword tapped on each shoulder and given a <a href="Home.html#coa" class="kword">coat of arms</a>. By the end of the medieval times, the knights became an impractical part of any army for two main reasons. The first reason is because countries began to train their own men forming their own armies, which meant that they no longer needed to call on other knights for military aid. The drastic change in warfare is the other reason why knights were no longer practical. The early development of firearms and other trajectory weapons, such as the longbow, made the heavy armored and slow-moving knights ineffective. </p2>

            <!-- Paragraph: topic 3 -->
            <p2 class="para wow fadeIn delay-1s">Large amounts of people started to move away from big trading centers because of the threats of <a href="Home.html#nom" class="kword">nomadic</a> bands attacking. Around this time, a population boom took place due to warming climate cycles, as a result of which people started to settle in towns and rural communities. Many towns were able to grow through providing services to <a href="Home.html#cru" class="kword">crusaders</a>. Since trade was starting to grow along the army's routes, a merchant letter system developed instead of people having to carry large amounts of silver around. With the invention of merchant letters, there was a need for an institution to organize and control the system so banks were established. These changes began a shift from towns to cities, the latter being defined as urban centers with a Bishop’s cathedral. Walls were built around the borders for defence. </p2>

                    <p1 class="para wow fadeIn" style="text-align: right;">During the medieval ages, education was mainly for the <a href="Home.html#nob" class="kword">nobles</a> and members of the <a href="Home.html#cle" class="kword">clergy</a>, as lower classes could not afford it. Schooling often took place in churches and monasteries. The subjects that were being taught at the time were Latin based and included grammar, reading, and writing. The main reasons that medieval education revolved around Latin was primarily from the influence of the church, as it considered Latin a sacred language. The bible and church masses were all written or preached in Latin, and accordingly, teaching Latin allowed those who were educated to understand the teachings of the church. An additional reason was the ability of students to use it while trading or communicating with foreigners. Both an English merchant and a Dutch merchant did not know how to speak the other’s language, so their main way of communicating was by using Latin. School materials, such as books, were quite rare and extremely expensive at the time, therefore preventing schools from providing such materials to their students. Eventually individual schools started to open where teachers would try to attract students who were willing to learn and who could afford a fee. These schools transformed to educational <a href="Home.html#gui" class="kword">guilds</a> or “universitas” in Latin. Guilds were independent of the church and organized by artisans, professionals, and skilled crafts people. They were made to protect members from competition and to begin an apprenticeship system. They also provided social services to their workers. Guilds led to upper class families taking control of city councils who patronized the arts and the church and won rights to self-government. Large cities that became very powerful and established were considered a <a href="Home.html#com" class="kword">commune</a> which meant a city that was excused from taking commands from the <a href="Home.html#mon" class="kword">monarchy</a>. Local nobles were seen as overlords to protect the communes. </p1>

                    <p1 class="para wow fadeIn delay-1s">A woman’s place, during medieval times, was very restricted and controlled.  Women were <a href="Home.html#sub" class="kword">subordinate</a> to men, with specific roles in the family and in the community, that kept them dependent.  Many of the organizations, activities, and topics discussed only involved the work of men, as at the time women were considered the inferior gender and <a href="Home.html#subser" class="kword">subservient</a> to men, whether they be their father, husband, or other <a href="Home.html#kin" class="kword">kinsmen</a>. A woman served her family until she married and then she served her husband.  Once married, her role was in the home, raising children, cooking, cleaning, and caring for her husband.  She also had chores on the land, of a more limited nature, and in support of men’s work.  She had no legal rights – no right to vote, no right to own land, and no right to divorce her husband.  Women’s roles in society varied by class. Wealthier women had hired help, but they remained subservient to their husbands.  She was afforded more opportunities for work, such as being able to participate in trading or becoming money lenders.  The poorer, <a href="Home.html#peas" class="kword">peasant</a> women, in comparison, were limited to the tasks of making textiles, planting crops, taking care of livestock on top of their childcare and household duties.  Even those women who worked for <a href="Home.html#rem" class="kword">remuneration</a> were paid significantly less than men, and they had very limited opportunities for higher education.  Women were restricted from admission to many venues, and they had no decision making within the family unit.</p1>

Here we will end the course moving through how the medieval era ended and how the world continued to grow by taking a look at The Renaissance. The word renaissance literally means rebirth, which was very fitting for the time period that is marked by many drastic changes including to the arts, the economy, and medicine. The name was also a symbol for humanity reforming as they had just come out of the Black Plague. As you will most definitely notice, the heart of The Renaissance takes place in Italy, where there was a concentration of wealth, power, and intellect at the time.

                    <p2 class="para wow fadeInRight">There was a revival of trade and commerce that took place during the late middle ages that created new ways of earning wealth. By the early 1500’s, the <a href="Home.html#feu" class="kword">feudal economy</a> was replaced by a <a href="Home.html#cap" class="kword">capitalist economy</a>. It was starting to become an important trend to spend money in order to earn money. There was an increase in lending money in order to earn interest on it, which went against church law but nevertheless occurred. Banking systems at the time were established by the most wealthy families who could lend their money to people with interest attached. One of these families would be the Medici. They became one of the wealthiest families in all of Europe and would, for the most part, work behind the scenes. The system of lending money to people and keeping records of these financial interactions would later influence the creation of modern credit systems. </p2>

            <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">In the Middle Ages, people were often purposely depicted smaller than religious figures to show the insignificance of humanity. Renaissance artists rejected the conventions of the Middle Ages, and instead chose to glorify humans and place them at the center of the universe. At this time, artists began to focus on perfect human form rather than displaying any imperfections. Perspective was also rediscovered and practiced more often, allowing artists to create paintings that were much more realistic and created a sense of depth. Sculptures were heavily influenced by the renewed interest in classical works and the trend towards <a href="Home.html#nat" class="kword">naturalism</a>. Naturalism was a mix of <a href="Home.html#rea" class="kword">realism</a> with <a href="Home.html#mys" class="kword">mysticism</a>. It was made to depict the ability and beauty of the human body. Many characteristics were adopted from Greek and Roman art. This new style of art was meant to capture the experience of the individual and a reflection of daily life for the common people, unlike the old medieval style.</p2>

                    <p class="para wow fadeIn">A major change that The Renaissance provided to society was a significant development in medicine. What generated the shift in medical practices was the new acceptance society and law had for <a href="Home.html#dis" class="kword">dissection</a> of human corpses. Before The Renaissance, the church believed it to be wrong to dissect a person’s corpse. This was because they thought that dissecting a body would take away the dignity of the deceased, who should be buried whole. The new process of dissection allowed <a href="Home.html#phy" class="kword">physicians</a> to carry out numerous amounts of anatomical studies, leading to the discovery of many important aspects of human <a href="Home.html#ana" class="kword">anatomy</a>. Another important aspect of medical development in The Renaissance was the transfer of medical techniques from the middle east. Physicians from the Islamic world had made many important medical breakthroughs, and through the return of <a href="Home.html#cru" class="kword">crusaders</a> and Muslims fleeing to Europe, European physicians learned of the different practices that were done in the middle east, allowing them to apply these techniques and discoveries to their own work.  </p>

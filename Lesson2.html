            <!-- paragraph: topic 1 -->
            <p2 class="para wow fadeInUp">The Black Plague or Black Death was a <a href="Home.html#pan" class="kword">pandemic</a> that terrorized Europe for almost 11 years, from 1342 to 1353. The plague existed before the large outbreak in Europe, but it later developed into the medieval time’s most contagious and deadly disease. Even before the outbreak, rumours were spreading across Europe about a great pestilence making its way through the trade routes. In the early 1340s, the plague had already struck India, Persia, Egypt, China, and Syria. The most notable symptom of the plague included swelling in both the groin and armpit areas which took on a terrible black colour, giving the plague the name Black Death. The black sores, which could cover the whole body in general were called <a href="Home.html#bub" class="kword">buboes</a>, which is also how it received the other name, the Bubonic Plague. Victims of the Bubonic Plague also experienced other symptoms such as chills, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, potentially leading to death. What is less known is the fact that there were actually two other variations of the plague going around at the time. These two plagues were called the Septicemic Plague and the Pneumonic Plague. The difference between all three types of plague were the location of infection. Septicemic Plague was a plague within the blood, Bubonic Plague was an infection in the lymph nodes, and Pneumonic Plague was an infection in the lungs. What is also most notable about these other types of plague is that during the medieval times, the death rate arising from them was an astounding 100%, while compared with the Bubonic Plague's death rate of 75%. During the winter months, the plague turned into a state of pneumonia that was spread through coughing and sneezing, which relates especially back to Pneumonic plague. Unfortunately, doctors at the time had no way of curing the plague. At the time, doctors would practice unsafe and unsanitary methods such as <a href="Home.html#blo" class="kword">bloodletting</a> and boil lancing, followed by other superstitious practices. With no effective cure, bodies began to pile up across Europe, giving body collectors plenty of work to do. Body collectors would walk around the streets of cities and towns to collect the dead plague victims and carry them to mass graves where the bodies would be piled up in layers. The Black Death would be without a doubt history’s worst pandemic.  </p2>

                    <!-- Pargraph 1: topic 2 -->
                    <p class="para wow fadeIn">To this day, historians are still debating what the main method of contamination was for the Black Death.  The most popular current belief is that the plague rapidly spread throughout the world by carriers such as rats and fleas that travelled along the trade routes and roads around the world, spreading it from Asia to Europe. These trade routes were either pathways like the <a href="Home.html#sil" class="kword">silk road</a>, or through the seas with rat-infested boats sailing across the world. Other things such as social interaction with those who were infected, and prolonged presence with numerous infected corpses, also helped to spread the disease rapidly throughout the world.  “Outbreak scares” were another source of spreading the disease.  An outbreak of plague in any city or town caused occupants to flee the scene in hopes of being spared from the plague.  The impact of this was to help the disease spread more rapidly as some of those who would leave would in fact carry the plague to whatever location they decided to settle in next. A huge peak in the spread of the plague happened in Europe from 1347 to 1351.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Paragraph 2: topic 2 -->
                    <p class="para wow fadeIn">What is often overlooked is how the Black Death also had a huge effect on animals as well. The plague went on to affect livestock such as cows, goats, pigs, sheep, and chickens. In fact, such large numbers of sheep were dying due to the plague that a shortage of wool in Europe resulted. Those who decided to eat the dying animals would also become contaminated with the plague no matter how well they cooked the animal.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- Paragraph 3: topic 2 -->
                    <p class="para wow fadeIn">New tactics of warfare rose during the time of the plague. During a <a href="Home.html#sie" class="kword">siege</a>, attackers would take infected corpses and catapult them over castle walls to hopefully infect, and also, terrify those who were occupying the fort.</p>

                    <!-- paragraph 1: topic 3 -->
                    <p class="para wow fadeIn">With the decline in population, began a decline in the social and economic structures of the world. People began to abandon friends and family, fled cities, and isolated themselves from the outside world. Few doctors were willing to see their patients, <a href="Home.html#cle" class="kword">clergymen</a> refused to give last rites, and funeral ceremonies were altogether deserted and instead replaced with mass burials. Some people believed that the plague was the result of God’s wrath and attempted to fight the plague with prayer. Faith in religion began to decrease after the plague, caused by those questioning the death of many clergymen dying from the plague and the fact that prayer did not prevent the plague from spreading, much less eradicate it.  Some people of the Christain faith used Jewish people as a <a href="Home.html#sca" class="kword">scapegoat</a>. Rumors of Jews poisoning public wells to ruin European life spread across Europe. This suspicion was, of course, spread by the Christians who noticed that fewer Jews were dying to plague compared to Christians, likely due to their more hygienic way of life. This all resulted in the torture, slaughter, and destruction of Jewish towns and people.</p>

                    <p class="para wow fadeIn"><a href="Home.html#gui" class="kword">Guilds</a> started to become more protective of their crafts and would often make sure no innovations took place in their field, while also stopping their apprenticeship programs. People began to move away from urban centers because the guilds would not let any newcomers in. This only applied to those within city limits, so craftsmen began to move to the countryside. Agricultural production began to drop because of a large decline in labour workers. As it became more difficult to produce goods with a constantly decreasing population of labour workers, the prices for both goods produced locally, and imported from elsewhere, skyrocketed.</p>

            <!-- Paragraph 1: topic 4 -->
            <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">The Black Death caused the most catastrophic drop in the human population. Although the plague never really fully went away, during its major outbreak around the world it managed to kill an estimated number of 25 million people, almost a third of the world’s population at the time. The plague, without a doubt, caused large amounts of grief, but it also provided pivotal changes that helped bring society to where it is today. Historians believe that the plague naturally selected those who were frail or weak, and left behind a healthier and stronger gene pool. In turn, those who survived started a generation full of people with stronger <a href="Home.html#imm" class="kword">immunities</a> to such illnesses.  </p2>
            <br>
            <!-- paragraph 2: topic 4 -->
            <p2 class="para wow fadeIn">Because of the absence of many workers, peasants were able to start to benefit from the effects of a new rise of <a href="Home.html#wag" class="kword">wages</a>. Lower class workers were now able to hold more power in negotiations with their landlords and, in turn, were able to earn larger amounts of money. In the end, land was plenty and wages were extremely high. As a result, the lines between classes began to blur and the <a href="Home.html#feu" class="kword">feudalism</a> system quickly began to fall apart. Ultimately, the Black Death brought drastic changes to the world as a whole and marked the end of the medieval era, leading humanity to the Renaissance.</p2>
